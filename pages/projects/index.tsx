          <p>
            <strong>Another year, another rewrite.</strong> In the past Iâ€™ve
            rewritten Fight Scores from Objective C to Swift 1, and from Swift 1
            to Swift 3. This year I converted to Swift v5 and removed any trace
            of interface builder while rethinking the entire experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a period with zero new
            boxing events across the entire planet. So a large part of
            rethinking how users were interacting with Fight Scores was putting
            renewed focus on histrical fights.

          <p>
            The existing framework remains the same from previous versions, I
            constructed a robust yet flexible database and API in Ruby on Rails,
            which I host on Linode. The universal iOS client is now using Swift
            5, and the web interface is using Rails. There&lsquo;s a marketing
            website and blog available at{' '}
            <a href='https://fightscores.co'>fightscores.co</a>, the app itself
            is available to download for free on the App Store.

          <p>
            Since 2016, I&lsquo;ve been leading the design efforts on Elastic
            Cloud, the official hosted offering of Elasticsearch.
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined the Cloud team early on and performed very much as the lone
            designer-developer, working to identify and produce solutions to UI
            issues while helping out the UI devs in the React codebase.
            Following an organisation reshuffle, I&lsquo;ve been working to
            establish and build out a design team in Cloud. While I still spend
            a lot of time directly contributing to projects, I also provide
            longer-term product vision and direction as well as guidance to our
            ever growing set of designers.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the team has become more mature, we&lsquo;ve been able to
            increase our user testing efforts and have used that to successfully
            position design further upstream in our project.

            platform, ClientWorks. In November 2016, it was successfully rolled
            out to 15,000 financial advisor to unanimously positive feedback.

          <p>
            GoHealth is a health insurance startup located in River North,
            Chicago. I was part of the core team that programmed and launched an
            online marketplace for health insurance on October 1st 2013, making
            GoHealth one of the first companies to do so when President
            Obama&lsquo;s health care law came into effect. In addition to our
            own product, we also provided white labelled services to some of the
            largest companies in the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, I was part of the team that established, then outlined
            the User Experience for the project. Once development started my
            role was to guide front-end interactive design and development. That
            role entailed creating, maintaining and scaling stylesheets, coding
            page templates and creating directives to handle behaviour for any
            advanced UI functionality required. The GoHealth Health Insurance
            Exchange Marketplace can be found at GoHealthInsurance.com .

          <p>
            Corkings is an ongoing side project of mine. One of my personal
            passions is wine, so I decided to combine that with my passion for
            web development and create an online wine community. With Corkings,
            wine enthusiasts can discover, review and share wines, as well as
            follow what their friends are drinking.

            The site has been through many iterations and took me about a
            year&lsquo;s work, evenings and weekends, to get it to the point
            it&lsquo;s at today, a robust and reliable web application. As I
            found out, there are many different many different facets to
            building a social networking site, from logins, passwords and
            storing user information securely, to designing an experience that
            is informative without being overwhelming, friendly without being
            juvenile. It has been, and continues to be a great learning
            experience for myself.

            I&lsquo;m currently working on an iOS companion to make it easier to
