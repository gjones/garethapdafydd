Just a quick post to share the current app setup on my iPhone 5S, I often see others share theirs and always find it interesting so I thought I would do the same.

Before I get into the apps - I like to keep my background wallpaper light and simple, I’ve found the photographic backgrounds always seem a little too cluttered for my liking.

###	First Screen

_Springboard page 1_

Here is where I keep the most used apps that I own, again I like to leave the bottom line clear because the screen gets a little overwhelming if there is no space. [Fantastical 2](http://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone) is my go-to calendar app, the recent upgrade making it even better than before. No surprises with my Twitter client of choice, for me, [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/) reigns supreme in this category and [Felix](http://tigerbears.com/felix/) is a great app for keeping up to date with my friends over on App.Net. 

The second row is dedicated to reading and writing, Evernote saves my thoughts while [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/ipad/) saves the articles I would like to read later. [Reeder 2](http://reederapp.com/ios/) keeps me up to date with my RSS feeds while Zite suggests new articles and topics that I might be interested in. I don’t listen to too much music, preferring podcasts (hence Instacast replacing the built in music app in the bottom bar), but when I am in the mood it’s through Rdio. [1Password](http://learn.agilebits.com/1Password4/iOS/) is a must for me and makes the experience of everyday browsing on a desktop so much easier.

### Second Screen

_Springboard page 2_

The first line of the second page is dedicated to my health apps, Fitbit to track and sync my steps each day, [iSmoothRun](http://www.ismoothrun.com') when I’m going out for a long run as I prefer it's GPS and auto start/stop over the official Runkeeper app, which I still use for logging if I’m on a treadmill. The Withings app just allows me to keep an eye of my weight. 

The second row is reserved for the only other social media apps I use of a regular basis, and also HipChat, as I use that for communication with co-workers. The third is my banking section, for checking balances, making transfers and deposits etc. 

One of my favourite new discoveries kicks off the forth row, 
[FotMob](http://www.fotmob.com) is a must have for any fan of football, I love being able to quickly check the results in all the leagues across the world with such ease. [Radium](http://catpigstudios.com) is the best app for allowing me to listen to my British radio stations on both my phone and my mac, while I now use the Dropbox app a lot since migrating all of my photos out of iPhoto.

### Third Screen

The third and final screen contains a mixture of the apps I use semi-regularly along with the folders full of my other apps. I won’t go into too much detail here as it’s ever changing.
