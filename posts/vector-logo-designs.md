I just thought I'd share a couple of logo designs that I've been working on recently for a personal project. I've created these shields using vector graphics in Sketchapp. I had tried a number of different shapes but felt that the shield best captured the look I was going for.

The font that I have used is called [AxeHandel](http://www.dafont.com/axehandel.font'), I feel that it's clear and readible while managing to give a nod to the old-timey boxing logos and posters that I grew up with. I tried gloves as the central focal point but in the end decided that the boxer silhouttes fitted a little better.

I think I'm going to use the third option, (center, bottom). Do you agree? Let me know your thoughts at [@garethapdafydd](http://twitter.com/garethapdafydd).
