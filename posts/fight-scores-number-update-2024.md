It’s that time of year again when I like to look back on past twelve months and analyse the health of my iOS and iPadOS app, [Fight Scores](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fight-scores-2-boxing-scorecards/id1125374157?ls=1&mt=8). If you’d like to read my past posts on this topic, see the [2021](/thoughts/fight-scores-by-the-numbers) and [2023](/thoughts/fight-scores-number-update) versions.

Due to commitments at work and upheaval in my personal life, 2024 saw only one new release, and that was way back in January. This is not something that I’m proud of, there are lots of features and improvements I’d like to make to Fight Scores, and I hope to see this number increase significantly in the coming year. That said, I did make substantial improvements to the infrastructure, this was necessary to maintain performance during some of the huge matchups that took place this year.

Thanks to a very strong schedule filled with quality matchups throughout 2024, Fight Scores had a second straight breakout year when it comes to activity. New fights were up a staggering 41%, largely due to the two huge events between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk. However the growth wasn't only coming from the big fights, even taking those numbers out, throughout the year, on average we saw many more scorecards being created on a weekly basis.

The chart above really paints the picture here. 2024 was a monster year for user growth registering a massive 150% increase over 2023. As in previous years, we've seen much of the user growth occurring before major events, but a good number have gone on to become regular, engaged users. You'll see evidence of this below, as the domestic UK rematch between Josh Taylor and Jack Caterall produced numbers that we would not have seen in previous years.

### The state of boxing

2024 was another bumper year for boxing with huge fights taking place, mainly in Saudi Arabia. Looking back, this might have been the best year of boxing in my lifetime, as fight fans we got pretty much everything we could have asked for. Boxing has never been a sport with a moral compass so I'm going to sidestep the tough questions about Saudi sports washing at this point and concentrate on what we got. 

From AJ’s demolition of Ngannou in February, to the long-awaited clashes between Devin Haney and Ryan Garcia, and Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol, culminating in Oleksandr Usyk’s masterclass in the Fury rematch just before Christmas — it’s clear we’re living through a golden spell for boxing. This packed schedule more than made up for the previously mentioned lack of app updates, resulting in a staggering 41% increase in new fights.

Looking at the all time list of most popular fights, you can see that 2024 dominates with 7 of the top 10, thats a hugely healthy statistic both for the sport of boxing and for Fight Scores as an app.
